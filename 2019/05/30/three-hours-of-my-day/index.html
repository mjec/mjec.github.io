<p>Earlier this year I was promoted to be a staff software engineer. This
involves being not just problem solving, but also a (partial) responsibility
for the culture of my workplace.</p>

<p>One of the things I struggled with for a long time &ndash; long before I was working
as a full-time programmer &ndash; was a lack of understanding of how senior people
were able to come up with the clever ideas they come up with. Sometimes it&rsquo;s a
stroke of inspiration. More often, I think, it comes from hard work. There are
elements of experience and knowledge and pattern recognition, but fundamentally
it is hard work.</p>

<p>I wanted to use this post as a way of exposing what that hard work sometimes
looks like. It&rsquo;s not about typing code quickly. It&rsquo;s about thinking slowly,
until the right answer becomes obvious.</p>

<p>This post is long, but the point is not the technical solution, it&rsquo;s that the
process was longer than it seems from the result. And that&rsquo;s not only okay,
that&rsquo;s the only way anyone works.</p>

<h2 id="some-context">Some context</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m building a small service at work, which you might think of as kind of a
cut-price <a href="https://sentry.io">Sentry</a>.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:0"><a href="#fn:0">1</a></sup> Specifically, by invoking one line of
code you can record a PHP stack trace at that location; and you can do so in a
manner that ensures only one copy of each unique trace is stored. With a high
volume of requests (thousands per second) this is far more economical than
using our logging pipeline.</p>

<p>This is a system with very high write volume (up to once per request), but a
very low read volume (it will only be consumed by developers). We&rsquo;re extremely
tolerant to write failures, as you might expect, or even total data loss. The
volume of persistent data is likely to be hundreds of megabytes to single digit
gigabytes.</p>

<p>The storage backend we settled on was Redis, for a range of reasons both
technical and organizational.</p>

<p>I have been working on spinning up the service and having it record data. Until
today, I didn&rsquo;t give much thought to the structure of the data consumer. We want
something a bit nicer than using <code>telnet</code> as a Redis client, and I&rsquo;d originally
thought I&rsquo;d whip up a little mini-app, integrated into our back office systems.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-suggestions">A few suggestions</h2>

<p>As part of the architecture review process<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup> I got a number of comments, but
for our purposes today I just want to highlight one of them.</p>

<p>That suggestion is that rather than writing a frontend for querying this data,
I could instead use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/">Google BigQuery</a>.
This was a great suggestion, because it meant I could focus on the bits I enjoy
and am good at, instead of building and supporting a user interface. It also
enables new uses of the data without more code being written. Great!</p>

<p>So now the project has shifted a bit. It will still be exactly what I thought,
but we need to get the data into BigQuery.</p>

<h2 id="something-i-did-today">Something I did today</h2>

<p>Today I decided I should figure out how we would get the data into BigQuery. I&rsquo;m
tempted to fully set out the constraints here, but that would spoil the ending.
Instead, I&rsquo;ll try to take you through my thinking process.</p>

<p>I started by reading through the BigQuery documentation, to see what sort of
limits I was likely to face there. BigQuery is designed as a column-oriented
analytic data store for huge volumes of data that occasionally changes. The
normal workload for this system would involve occasionally loading large
immutable datasets &ndash; probably terrabytes of new rows loaded once a day, with
no updates.</p>

<p>But my dataset is small, so maybe I could manipulate the system a bit.</p>

<p>My first natural instinct was to see whether we could use BigQuery as a backing
store without Redis. I was pretty sure this was a terrible idea, and I was
right. BigQuery tables are limited to 1,000 updates a day; we need thousands of
updates a second.</p>

<p>Still, we could regularly push batches of data to BigQuery. Once every two
minutes would be 720 updates a day. That gives us some headroom for an
occasional manual change.</p>

<p>But what would the batches be? We need to have some idea of the state of what is
in BigQuery to know what needs to be updated. We could use <code>MERGE</code> queries, but
these are expensive and not best practice. And anyway, I&rsquo;d still have to run a
<code>SCAN</code> across the entire Redis store to get the state of the world. It seems
wasteful and difficult to try to merge the two.</p>

<p>So another idea: I can just re-load the whole dataset every few minutes. That
process is pretty simple: I do a <code>SCAN</code>, dump the data out to JSON (one record
per line), and trigger a load into BigQuery. I&rsquo;m allowed to do that pretty
often; it can be done without impacting write availability of Redis; and to boot
data loads into BigQuery are free.</p>

<p>My plan was to use a cron job that would do this periodic sweeping of a new copy
of the data into BigQuery. This seems totally reasonable; we just need to make
sure we don&rsquo;t try to write two copies of the table at once. I wanted this to be
relatively cloud native too, so I didn&rsquo;t want to store any local state.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">3</a></sup></p>

<p>So enter what seemed to be to be the simplest locking mechanism: a file in GCS.
But now we&rsquo;re dealing with lock files and that means race conditions, so I
thought I would try to diagram it out, to ensure I wasn&rsquo;t missing an edge case.
When things invariably fail, I want the system to recover without difficulty.</p>

<p>So I opened up <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/">Lucidchart</a> and got to diagramming.</p>

<h2 id="success">Success!</h2>

<p>After an hour or more, I had come up with what I thought of as the most
simplified version of this system. There wre more lines crossing than I was
happy about, but ultimately it seemed reasonable.</p>

<p><img alt="The flowchart for this system; with significant complexity" src="/images/2019-05-21-prod-backtrace-bigquery-version-1.png" style="height: 610px"></p>

<h2 id="reasonable-ish">Reasonable-ish</h2>

<p>I mean, that seems reasonable, but it has a lot of moving parts. At this point
though the flowchart looks pretty nice. There aren&rsquo;t many overlapping lines, and
the overlapping lines are all sensible enough. We appear to have handled most of
the edge cases gracefully. At this point I&rsquo;ve spent about three hours on this,
and honestly I&rsquo;m pretty proud of myself.</p>

<p>But I didn&rsquo;t stop there.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s important. That is the difference between junior-engineer me and
senior-engineer me. Junior-engineer me would have stopped. I would be done. I
would have shared this out, or just built it.</p>

<p>Today I didn&rsquo;t stop there. I looked at the system I&rsquo;d built, and then I went
back with a critical eye. I remembered reading something in the BigQuery
documentation about external data sources, including JSON in GCS. Maybe I could
manage less of this process.</p>

<p>And it turns out that for this use case, JSON in GCS being queried by BigQuery
is totally appropriate. We have to be a little cautious, but upload-and-replace
in GCS is atomic (or at least can be) and the performance characteristics aren&rsquo;t
so bad. We lose the ability to do things like partitioning and clustering to
reduce query cost, but the datasets are small enough that it doesn&rsquo;t really
matter.</p>

<p>And so I threw away two or more hours of work, and came up with this simpler
version. So simple it doesn&rsquo;t even need a flowchart.</p>

<p><img alt="The flowchart for the second version of this syste; with significantly less complexity" src="/images/2019-05-21-prod-backtrace-bigquery-version-2.png" style="height: 450px"></p>

<h2 id="the-lesson">The lesson</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s okay to throw away time. I might have felt guilty about wasting this time.
That&rsquo;s my instinct. I felt defensive &ndash; against myself! &ndash; of the thing I had
spent a couple of hours creating. I had to work against my instincts, overcome
my insecurities, to assess honestly what the better solution was.</p>

<p>My time is pretty expensive to my employer. A couple of hours is nothing to
sneeze at. But spending that time, and then spending the extra half hour to
reassess and convince myself of the obviously-better approach will pay many
times that time cost in dividends. I don&rsquo;t have to ask others to review this;
the complexity of the code is reduced; the time to build the system is reduced
by well more than two hours.</p>

<p>This is what it means to be a senior engineer.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">4</a></sup> Tonight, having thrown away
all this work, feeling like I wasted that time, I actually feel more comfortable
with my title than I have perhaps ever before.</p>
