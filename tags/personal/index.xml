      <description>What follows is a transcript of a letter my father sent to me when I was four years old, with annotations from me typing it up in italics but otherwise reproduced as faithfully as possible. It was written with a word processor and printed on dot matrix paper. My father was working in Indonesia while we were living in Australia. I only hope that if I ever have children, I can answer every question they have in this way.</description>

      <description>Twenty fucking sixteen. A terrible year for the world, in all sorts of ways. Highlights of shit for me include Brexit, President Trump, the death of Carrie Fisher, the ever-worsening crisis in Syria, the terrible epedemic of opiod addiction, the proliferation of neo-nazis and the increase in systemic discrimination against trans and non-binary individuals.
For me personally though, 2016 was excellent. Because good is always relative, I want to give you a brief rundown of 2015 first, so you can see why I loved 2016 so much.</description>

      <description>Last week was my first week at RC. That was obviously amazing. I did a heap of cool new stuff. It was very exciting. I stayed late most nights - once til about 3am. I learned Haskell&amp;rsquo;s basics and I started studying algorithms. Algorithm study meant spending some time doing mathematics again, which was very cool. At the end of the week I spent some time fixing bugs in the TDU website, which meant thinking back in the python/web model.</description>

      <title>Travelling is hard</title>

      <description>I have a place to live. I have tickets. I have a purpose, starting 28 March. Now I just need to get there.
I always forget how much effort is involved in travelling. I have the rest of the day to pack my things and then I leave the house around 4am tomorrow. I&amp;rsquo;ll arrive at my temporary accommodation about thirty hours later (assuming no delays).
Packing itself is hard. There is a lot just in deciding what to take (and what to take carry-on).</description>
