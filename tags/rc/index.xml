      <description>RC is amazing.
Today is my last day at RC. I am sad I&amp;rsquo;m leaving, and I thought it might be worthwhile to publish a few thoughts about my time here.
The space Picture this: SoHo, New York City. Next to Chinatown and Little Italy. Surrounding streets closed surprisingly often for filming. Locations recognizable from TV. On the second floor, an open plan workspace, with breakout rooms named for giants of computer science.</description>

      <description>This is one of the nicest cities I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been to. And by that I mean the people in New York City are lovely.
This came as kind of a shock to me. Everyone talks about how New Yorkers are rude, or how this is a dangerous place. I have never felt that. I have been scared precisely once: walking through &amp;ldquo;downtown Brooklyn&amp;rdquo; at 3am, past a construction site on a dimly lit alley I rounded a hard corner and a plastic bag jumped out at me.</description>

      <description>One of the websites I maintain is for the Tasmanian Debating Union. I built a competition management system, a rewrite in Django of a system originally designed and built in PHP by my friend Pat.
The database schema for this system includes a table with one row per debate. Those debates have associated teams (one affirmative, one negative) and an outcome (e.g. affirmative win, negative win). There&amp;rsquo;s therefore no single column to select the winning team.</description>

      <description>Aside: I started writing this post back in May, and have finally had a chance to finish it! Particular thanks to Benson who worked with me on the ultimate solution.
How did we get here? There&amp;rsquo;s a tendency in a lot of web development to be cautious of the data layer. We outsource persistence to the magic of PostgreSQL (or MySQL or MariaDB or SQL Server or Mongo or Redis or whatever) and just kind of ignore how it works.</description>

      <description>Note: This post uses and discusses strong profanity, gendered and racist slurs.
Last night at RC we had a karaoke night of sorts. I queued up Nosebleed Secction and the few Australians in the room sung it with great gusto. It&amp;rsquo;s the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve felt any kind of nationalistic sentiment since I&amp;rsquo;ve been here.
There&amp;rsquo;s one particular sequence of lyrics which triggered the writing of this post:

      <title>Non-proofs</title>

      <description>Today I read a thread of fake proofs on /r/math. The whole thread is great, but perhaps my favourite is the following &amp;ldquo;proof&amp;rdquo; I reproduce here.
We attempt to find:
$$\int \frac{1}{f} \frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}x}$$
Let $\mathrm{d}u = - \frac{1}{f^2}\mathrm{d}x$ and $v = f$.
Then we use the ordinary method of integration by parts:
$$\int u \mathrm{d}v = uv - \int v \mathrm{d}u$$
Substituting:
$$\int \frac{1}{f} \mathrm{d}f = \frac{1}{f}f - \int f - \frac{1}{f^2} \mathrm{d}f$$</description>

      <title>An idea for trusted brute-force-resistant two-factor-authenticated full disk encryption</title>

      <description>I was privileged to see Matthew Garrett&amp;rsquo;s talk at LCA this year on tpmtotp. This is software which enables you to verify that your computer hardware has not been tampered with before you are required to enter your full disk encryption password. It does this by sealing the TOTP secret in the TPM against a particular set of platform control register values. This means that if any aspect of the boot configuration changes the secret cannot be unsealed, so an attacker cannot pretend to be you.</description>

      <title>My Haskell was slow</title>

      <description>I have a Haskell function that builds frequency tables. It is very slow (and not very good). Originally this post was to look at why, and try to find a way to speed it up.
It turns out that GHC (the Haskell compiler) includes some nice profiling tools. You can set &amp;ldquo;cost centres&amp;rdquo; you want to look at using the {-# SCC &amp;quot;cost-centre-name&amp;quot; #-} pragma. So that&amp;rsquo;s what I did, and I have ended up with this:</description>

      <description>On Friday I came in on the tail end of a conversation explaining the solution to this problem. I think it&amp;rsquo;s pretty interesting.
Given a list of integers L and a target sum S, what&amp;rsquo;s the best way to find the pair x, y where x and y are both distinct elements of L such that x + y = S? We also want to be able to determine if there is no such pair.</description>

      <description>SICP is one of the standard books people study at RC. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely pretty cool, and something I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bit of experience with since getting half way through the 1986 lectures based on the book.
We have a study group for SICP that I have been involved with. Today one of the problems we looked at was 1.13, which is as follows:
 Prove that $Fib(n)$ is the closest integer to $\frac{\phi^n}{\sqrt{5}}$, where $\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$.</description>

      <description>I was surprised to hear that Haskell isn&amp;rsquo;t really a functional language so much as it&amp;rsquo;s a strongly typed one. I was of course aware that it had both these properties but it took really using it to see why the typing was so important.
I started on Monday afternoon with Learn You A Haskell. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty good. That, combined with a couple of group discussions sessions, has meant I&amp;rsquo;m feeling pretty confident.</description>

      <description>My first day of RC is today. I&amp;rsquo;ve been here for not quite four hours and so far:
 I have had conversations about mathematics education, the law and artificial intelligence
 I listened in on a conversation about graph theory
 I have met a number of awesome people from awesome places
 I have had a tongue-in-cheek vim vs emacs argument (vim 4 lyf!)
 I have been complimented on my tshirt at least three times</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start a blog. Again.
This time, I have something of a focus. I&amp;rsquo;ll be heading to New York City in a week or so to attend the recurse center.</description>
