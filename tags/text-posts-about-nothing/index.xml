      <description>What follows is a transcript of a letter my father sent to me when I was four years old, with annotations from me typing it up in italics but otherwise reproduced as faithfully as possible. It was written with a word processor and printed on dot matrix paper. My father was working in Indonesia while we were living in Australia. I only hope that if I ever have children, I can answer every question they have in this way.</description>

      <description>Twenty fucking sixteen. A terrible year for the world, in all sorts of ways. Highlights of shit for me include Brexit, President Trump, the death of Carrie Fisher, the ever-worsening crisis in Syria, the terrible epedemic of opiod addiction, the proliferation of neo-nazis and the increase in systemic discrimination against trans and non-binary individuals.
For me personally though, 2016 was excellent. Because good is always relative, I want to give you a brief rundown of 2015 first, so you can see why I loved 2016 so much.</description>

      <description>RC is amazing.
Today is my last day at RC. I am sad I&amp;rsquo;m leaving, and I thought it might be worthwhile to publish a few thoughts about my time here.
The space Picture this: SoHo, New York City. Next to Chinatown and Little Italy. Surrounding streets closed surprisingly often for filming. Locations recognizable from TV. On the second floor, an open plan workspace, with breakout rooms named for giants of computer science.</description>

      <description>Last week was my first week at RC. That was obviously amazing. I did a heap of cool new stuff. It was very exciting. I stayed late most nights - once til about 3am. I learned Haskell&amp;rsquo;s basics and I started studying algorithms. Algorithm study meant spending some time doing mathematics again, which was very cool. At the end of the week I spent some time fixing bugs in the TDU website, which meant thinking back in the python/web model.</description>

 I have had conversations about mathematics education, the law and artificial intelligence
 I listened in on a conversation about graph theory
 I have met a number of awesome people from awesome places
 I have had a tongue-in-cheek vim vs emacs argument (vim 4 lyf!)
 I have been complimented on my tshirt at least three times</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start a blog. Again.
This time, I have something of a focus. I&amp;rsquo;ll be heading to New York City in a week or so to attend the recurse center.</description>
