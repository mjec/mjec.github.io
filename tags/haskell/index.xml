      <description>I have a Haskell function that builds frequency tables. It is very slow (and not very good). Originally this post was to look at why, and try to find a way to speed it up.
It turns out that GHC (the Haskell compiler) includes some nice profiling tools. You can set &amp;ldquo;cost centres&amp;rdquo; you want to look at using the {-# SCC &amp;quot;cost-centre-name&amp;quot; #-} pragma. So that&amp;rsquo;s what I did, and I have ended up with this:</description>

      <description>I was surprised to hear that Haskell isn&amp;rsquo;t really a functional language so much as it&amp;rsquo;s a strongly typed one. I was of course aware that it had both these properties but it took really using it to see why the typing was so important.
I started on Monday afternoon with Learn You A Haskell. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty good. That, combined with a couple of group discussions sessions, has meant I&amp;rsquo;m feeling pretty confident.</description>
