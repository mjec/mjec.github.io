      <description>One of the websites I maintain is for the Tasmanian Debating Union. I built a competition management system, a rewrite in Django of a system originally designed and built in PHP by my friend Pat.
The database schema for this system includes a table with one row per debate. Those debates have associated teams (one affirmative, one negative) and an outcome (e.g. affirmative win, negative win). There&amp;rsquo;s therefore no single column to select the winning team.</description>
