      <description>Twenty fucking sixteen. A terrible year for the world, in all sorts of ways. Highlights of shit for me include Brexit, President Trump, the death of Carrie Fisher, the ever-worsening crisis in Syria, the terrible epedemic of opiod addiction, the proliferation of neo-nazis and the increase in systemic discrimination against trans and non-binary individuals.
For me personally though, 2016 was excellent. Because good is always relative, I want to give you a brief rundown of 2015 first, so you can see why I loved 2016 so much.</description>

      <description>Last week was my first week at RC. That was obviously amazing. I did a heap of cool new stuff. It was very exciting. I stayed late most nights - once til about 3am. I learned Haskell&amp;rsquo;s basics and I started studying algorithms. Algorithm study meant spending some time doing mathematics again, which was very cool. At the end of the week I spent some time fixing bugs in the TDU website, which meant thinking back in the python/web model.</description>
