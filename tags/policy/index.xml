      <description>There has been a bunch of discussion about electronic voting recently, from the bipartisan political support to Dan Nolan&amp;rsquo;s nuanced take. As someone with an interest in election technology, I have a few thoughts.
I don&amp;rsquo;t actually want to get too deep into the technology side of this discussion. There are lots of great critiques of electronic voting technologies. There are also some great technologies: end-to-end systems which provide verification of each individual vote; blockchain systems which provide cryptographic evidence that results are not modified anywhere along the chain.</description>
