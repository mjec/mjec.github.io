      <description>Today I read a thread of fake proofs on /r/math. The whole thread is great, but perhaps my favourite is the following &amp;ldquo;proof&amp;rdquo; I reproduce here.
We attempt to find:
$$\int \frac{1}{f} \frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}x}$$
Let $\mathrm{d}u = - \frac{1}{f^2}\mathrm{d}x$ and $v = f$.
Then we use the ordinary method of integration by parts:
$$\int u \mathrm{d}v = uv - \int v \mathrm{d}u$$
Substituting:
$$\int \frac{1}{f} \mathrm{d}f = \frac{1}{f}f - \int f - \frac{1}{f^2} \mathrm{d}f$$</description>

      <description>SICP is one of the standard books people study at RC. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely pretty cool, and something I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bit of experience with since getting half way through the 1986 lectures based on the book.
We have a study group for SICP that I have been involved with. Today one of the problems we looked at was 1.13, which is as follows:
 Prove that $Fib(n)$ is the closest integer to $\frac{\phi^n}{\sqrt{5}}$, where $\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$.</description>
