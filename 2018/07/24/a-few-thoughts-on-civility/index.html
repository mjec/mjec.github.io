  </div>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of civility. After all, I <a href="https://genius.com/The-indelicates-jerusalem-lyrics">excel at drama and formal debating</a>.</p>

<p><em>Aside: that was a joke, just a reference to a song I like. But for real, my time spent
debating made me value civility and formality as ways to convince people. As I&rsquo;ve become
more critical of the systems in which I live, it&rsquo;s become clear that the rules of
debate are <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/04/traditional-college-debate-white-privilege/360746/">a small system of oppression</a>.
I don&rsquo;t think that means we should stop having formal debates in accordance with
those rules, it&rsquo;s just something to be aware of, and a reason not to judge the
way people speak in general.</em></p>

<p>When we&rsquo;re evaluating behavior, there are two different ways to evaluate it. One
is: does this behavior achieve the intended effect; the other is should this
behavior be prohibited (and therefore punished).</p>

<p>When it comes to &ldquo;does this behavior achieve the intended effect&rdquo;, I think that&rsquo;s
not really important to a discussion about engaging with a political system, for
example by refusing to provide public accommodations to someone with whom you disagree.
Often in this case the behavior is an end in itself: a refusal to associate with
those with whom you disagree. There may be more effective ways of convincing people
of your opinion, of explaining why you disagree. But that&rsquo;s somewhat counterfactual;
you&rsquo;re not doing it to convince someone.</p>

<p>When we look at a broader context, we often see tone policing or attempts to limit
discussion until you can have the best possible take. This is, in my opinion, wasted
breath. People can say whatever they want. That&rsquo;s a laudable thing.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s instead talk about prohibition. Let&rsquo;s talk about when people can&rsquo;t say what
they want, because what they want to say is harmful.</p>

<p>Harm is kind of a difficult thing to measure. Is it harmful to see a
<abbr title="Make America Great Again">MAGA</abbr> hat at a conference when you&rsquo;re
not expecting it? Is it harmful to say you believe in nationalism, or in white
supremacy? To get really meta, is it harmful to say that holocaust denial should
be criminalized? Or to refuse to serve holocaust deniers?</p>

<p>Those questions are messy, and hard to evaluate. There are too many lines that
have to be drawn. And there&rsquo;s a danger in limiting free speech: the people in
power might not always agree with you. And you want to speak, even in that case.
Perhaps especially in that case.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s actually one very clear criterion we can use to determine when it is
permissible for speech to be banned. I feel like I probably stole this from
Christian Turner and Joe Miller over at <a href="http://oralargument.org/">Oral Argument</a>
but perhaps I picked it up elsewhere. Certainly, I didn&rsquo;t invent it.</p>

<p>One of the core elements of a liberal democracy is the idea that we have peaceful
transitions of power. If an opponent wins, they are entitled to take the elected
office. They are entitled to exercise their power, even if the exercise is one
with which I disagree. We all agree to the rules of the game, so to speak.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t question the right of the government, for example, to continue to collect
my taxes even when it&rsquo;s spending that money on things with which I vehemently
disagree. That&rsquo;s not compelled speech, that&rsquo;s just the way democracy works.</p>

<p>There are, of course, limits. There are elections we would not recognize, and
policies against which we would rebel.</p>

<p><em>As to whether this is lawful or not, check out Christian Turner&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.hydratext.com/legal-theory-101/">Modern American Legal Theory</a>
for a gentle, entertaining podcasted introduction to the concepts. Realistically
of course, it doesn&rsquo;t matter; if enough people are in rebellion, they are the
government. Just ask any government in exile.</em></p>

<p>The question of which policies against which you would rebel is obviously very
personal. Hopefully though we all agree that the threshold is much higher than
merely policies with which you disagree.</p>

<p>If you have in mind a policy that you would use violence to prevent in your
government - say, Nazism - then it is clear this is a policy against which you
are free to be uncivil. That flows easily, and it leads to a place where I am
quite comfortable. Your right to speak is unfettered as long as you&rsquo;re not trying
to undermine the <em>system</em> of government, as long as you&rsquo;re not trying to change
the rules of the game.</p>

<p>Does that mean that governmental systems cannot change? Of course not! There are
ways that you can make those changes. But you have to work within the system. It
is hard and it takes time and effort and consensus.</p>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t make the change you want within the system, <em>then</em> you have a choice.
You can accept that the system has made the decision and you can&rsquo;t change it. For
example, I firmly believe that everyone should have a right to vote, without any
minimum age. That is something I strongly believe, but not something likely to
be changed within the system any time soon. But I accept that harm (or what I see
as harm) because I recognize the system is working, and I think the system is good.</p>

<p>The other option is to abandon the system. This is dangerous, physically. Without
a system of laws, the winner of most arguments tends to be the person with greatest
brute strength. That isn&rsquo;t good. But it&rsquo;s a reasonable approach to take if you
believe so strongly in the harm that you think it outweighs all the good of the
system.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a clear criterion. The line varies from person to person, but it has some
nice results: Nazis can be punched, but you can&rsquo;t stop someone advocating for your
political opponent.</p>

<p>None of this, of course, is particularly novel, but I lay it out here as part of
my thinking process.</p>

<p>There are some interesting unresolved issues, of course, some of which are outlined
below.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What constitutes punishment? Need it be state action, or can one individual punish
another?</p></li>

<li><p>How should the system respond to overzealous defence? Should it back its defenders
and punish its adversaries, even when the defender causes harm to the adversary?
What does it mean for the response to be proportionate, when the disparity of
power between the system and its adversary is so large?</p></li>

<li><p>Wait explain again how this helps resolve the question?</p></li>
</ul>
